## Without Gramps MCP

Genealogy research with AI assistants is limited and frustrating:

- No direct access to your family tree data
- Manual data entry and research across multiple platforms
- Generic genealogy advice without context of your specific family
- No ability to automatically update or maintain your research

## With Gramps MCP

Gramps MCP provides AI assistants with direct access to your Gramps genealogy database through a comprehensive set of tools. Your AI assistant can now:

- **Smart Search**: Find people, families, events, places, and sources across your entire database
- **Data Management**: Create and update genealogy records with proper validation
- **Tree Analysis**: Trace descendants, ancestors, and family connections
- **Relationship Discovery**: Explore family connections and research gaps
- **Tree Information**: Get comprehensive tree statistics and track changes

Add Gramps MCP to your AI assistant and transform how you research family history:

```txt
Search for all descendants of John Smith born in Ireland before 1850
```

```txt
Create a new person record for Mary O'Connor with birth date 1823 in County Cork
```

```txt
Find all families missing marriage dates and suggest research priorities
```

No more manual data entry, no context switching between apps, no generic genealogy advice.

- Connect to your Gramps Web API
- Install Gramps MCP in your AI assistant
- Start intelligent genealogy research with natural language

## Installation

### Requirements

- **Gramps Web server** with your family tree data - [Setup Guide](https://www.grampsweb.org/install_setup/setup/)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- MCP-compatible AI assistant (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)

### Quick Start

1. **Ensure Gramps Web is Running**:
   - Follow the [Gramps Web setup guide](https://www.grampsweb.org/install_setup/setup/) to get your family tree online
   - Note your Gramps Web URL, username, and password
   - Find your tree ID under System Information in your Gramps Web interface

2. **Start the Server**:

```bash
# Download the configuration
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cabout-me/gramps-mcp/main/docker-compose.yml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cabout-me/gramps-mcp/main/.env.example
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Gramps Web API credentials

# Start the server
docker-compose up -d
```

That's it! The MCP server will be running at `http://localhost:8000/mcp`

### Alternative: Run Without Docker

If you prefer to run the server directly with Python:

1. **Setup Python Environment**:
```bash
# Install uv (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

2. **Run the Server**:
```bash
# HTTP transport (for web-based MCP clients)
uv run python -m src.gramps_mcp.server

# Stdio transport (for CLI-based MCP clients)
uv run python -m src.gramps_mcp.server stdio
```

The HTTP server will be available at `http://localhost:8000/mcp`, while stdio runs directly in the terminal.

### Media File Uploads

To use the `upload_media_file` and `update_media_file` tools with Docker, you need to mount a volume so the container can access your local files:

```bash
# Example: Mount a local media folder
docker run -d --name gramps-mcp -p 8000:8000 \
  -v /path/to/your/media:/media \
  -e GRAMPS_API_URL=https://your-gramps-web.com \
  -e GRAMPS_USERNAME=your-username \
  -e GRAMPS_PASSWORD=your-password \
  -e GRAMPS_TREE_ID=your-tree-id \
  gramps-mcp:latest
```

Then use `/media/filename.jpg` as the file path in the tool. When running without Docker (using uv directly), you can use absolute paths to any file on your system.

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file with your Gramps Web settings:

```bash
# Your Gramps Web instance (from step 1)
GRAMPS_API_URL=https://your-gramps-web-domain.com  # Without /api suffix - will be added automatically
GRAMPS_USERNAME=your-gramps-web-username
GRAMPS_PASSWORD=your-gramps-web-password
GRAMPS_TREE_ID=your-tree-id  # Find this under System Information in Gramps Web
```

## MCP Client Configuration

### Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop MCP configuration file (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

**Using Docker** (works with both pre-built and local images):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gramps": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["exec", "-i", "gramps-mcp-gramps-mcp-1", "python", "-m", "src.gramps_mcp.server", "stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Using uv directly** (if running without Docker):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gramps": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "python", "-m", "src.gramps_mcp.server", "stdio"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/gramps-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### OpenWebUI

OpenWebUI recommends using the [mcpo proxy](https://docs.openwebui.com/openapi-servers/mcp/) to expose MCP servers as OpenAPI endpoints.

**With uv:**
```bash
uvx mcpo --port 8000 -- uv run python -m src.gramps_mcp.server stdio
```

**With Docker:**
```bash
uvx mcpo --port 8000 -- docker exec -i gramps-mcp-gramps-mcp-1 uv run python -m src.gramps_mcp.server stdio
```

### Claude Code

**HTTP Transport:**
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http gramps http://localhost:8000/mcp
```

**Stdio Transport** (direct connection, more efficient):
```bash
# Using Docker
claude mcp add --transport stdio gramps "docker exec -i gramps-mcp-gramps-mcp-1 sh -c 'cd /app && python -m src.gramps_mcp.server stdio'"

# Using uv directly (requires local setup)
claude mcp add --transport stdio gramps "uv run python -m src.gramps_mcp.server stdio"
```

> **Transport Choice:** Use **stdio** for better performance and direct integration with CLI tools like Claude Code. Use **HTTP** when you need the server to handle multiple clients or prefer web-based access.

### Other MCP Clients

For any other MCP client, use the HTTP transport endpoint:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gramps": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

- **FastAPI**: HTTP server for MCP transport
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and serialization
- **httpx**: Async HTTP client for API communication
- **PyJWT**: JWT token authentication
- **python-dotenv**: Environment configuration


## Usage Examples

### Basic Search Operations

```txt
Find all people with the surname "Smith" born in Ireland
```

```txt
Show me recent changes to the family tree in the last 30 days
```

### Data Creation and Updates

```txt
Create a new person record for Patrick O'Brien, born 1845 in Cork, Ireland
```

```txt
Add a marriage event for John and Mary Smith on June 15, 1870 in Boston
```

### Genealogy Analysis

```txt

```


### Tree Information & Statistics

```txt
Show me statistics about my family tree - how many people, families, and events
```

```txt
What recent changes have been made to my family tree in the last week?
```

## Security

- JWT token authentication with automatic refresh
- Environment-based credential management
- Input validation using Pydantic models
- Secure HTTP transport with proper error handling
- No sensitive data exposed in tool responses


## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Connection refused errors**: Ensure your Gramps Web API server is running and accessible at the configured URL.

**Authentication failures**: Verify your username and password are correct and the user has appropriate permissions.

**Tool timeout errors**: Check your network connection and consider increasing timeout values for large datasets.

**Docker issues**: Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running.

### Debug Mode

To enable debug logging, check your application logs with:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```
